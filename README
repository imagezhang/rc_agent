This is a sample application derived from libupnp sample code.

The original sample compilation seems too complex. This one use a simplified 
Make file and should be easy to understand and modify.

In case of testing, probably we do not want to install libupnp directly to the
system. Before running the application, you should source setup.sh to setup
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the shared libraries required.
